# Introduction 
It has been estimated Earth is home to ***billions*** of microbes. An example of this is *E. coli*.

# Methods and Results
Grow soil bacteria on agar plates. 

## Analysis 
```{r}
2 + 2
```

# Discussion
One of the reasons why it's ***difficult*** to cultivate microbes from the environment in axenic conditions is becuase these can be *auxotrophs*. 

```{r setup}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
nhanes_small <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhance_small.csv"))
```

## Table of results

```{r mean-age-bmi-table}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    max_bmi = max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_bmi = min(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and bmi for each diabetes and education status")
```

## Prettier table 

```{r prettier-table}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    # Task 2a.
    mean_age = round(mean_age, 1),
    mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, 1),
    # Task 2b.
    education = str_to_sentence(education)
  ) %>%
  rename(
    # Task 3.
    "Diabetes Status" = diabetes,
    "Education" = education,
    "Mean Age" = mean_age,
    "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of Age and BMI for each education and diabetes status.")
```
    
```
